! The square wave is limited to occur every day, so frequency if fixed in V4.0
! tOn_pp is when the step up occurs, and tOff_pp when in steps down.  This are in days
! Note, the overhangs (< 0 on tOn and >1 on tOff) insures omg_pp can be fully on all day
! because of the nature of the exp step function and value of sigOmg_pp.
sigOmg_pp = 200. ! this is used in the exp setup function to make a "smooth" square wave

! Coupling between r_1,pp and r_2,pp.  If k_pp is set to zero (default) then reactions are not coupled
! but if k_pp > 0, then it sets the ratio of C_pp to pp (i.e., C_pp/pp = k_pp)
